For this program, it can be compiled and run by using the normal javac and java commands. The data files in which the program is getting the information from is found in the folder 'data' which can be found in the 'src' folder, along with the program source code.

The lab was a little challenging, but not too much. I liked doing the lab as it gave me more experiencing in using external data files in developing my program, which is a valuable skill to have in the real world. Although it was a little long and required to write a lot of code, as well as a lot of if/else statements for the different conditions and options that are provided for the user. But I think this was an overall great experience, and it clarified some questions I had about the implementation and usage of the FileUtility program, which really helps for my final project.
